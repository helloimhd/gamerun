### Rent it all out!

A CRUD app that allows you to rent board games for your events.


This project is done with the use of MVC, which utilizes PostgreSQL to create a database and manages interaction with the data. 
React.js is used for the front-end whilst running with Node.js.


How the app works:
* Admin (The one who is renting out the board games)
	- Admins will be able to add, edit, delete and view games from their product offerings
	- API is requested from BoardGameGeeks to get the details of the board games 
	- Manage orders and view members
	

* User (The one who will be renting the board games)
	- Users will be able to create and account and log in to manage their orders; from viewing the selection of games to renting them
